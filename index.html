    I am currently learning to code with <a href="https://www.codefirstgirls.org.uk">Code First: Girls</a> Going over everything from how the
    internet works, to creating websites and version control with git. A lot to cover in only 8 weeks!
    Everyone should learn to code, here are some pretty good reasons why...
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li> HTML is cool</li>
    <li id="lower">CSS is cooler</li>
    <li id="lowest">JS is the best</li>
    <!-- [these aren't used that much] id is a way to identify the specific list items - can identify them as whatever you want but can only use that identifier on one element - you then use a # to identify them in CSS, ie. #lowest-->
  </ol>
</div>
<div class="contrast">
  <!-- [these are used more often] class is another identifier, but you can use it multiple times, rather then just once. in CSS, you use . rather than #, ie. .contrast. -->
  <h2><em>What do you need to create a website?</em></h2>
  <p>Not much!</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A computer (always a good start)</li>
    <li>A text editor (I am using atom)</li>
    <li>A web browser (I am using chrome)</li>
    <li>Some HTML, CSS and JS files</li>
  </ul>
